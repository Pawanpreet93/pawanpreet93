                    From the past many years, people voicing their opinions about environmental degradation and climatic changes have been enormous and mostly urban development and technological advancements are blamed. But I still strongly feel that technology can play a significant role in combating this issue.

                    It’s common for people to not remember watering their plants on time. They are mostly unaware of individual water requirements of the plants they own. So from now, please gather information from the correct person like a gardener who can help you with the watering frequency and  quantity that your plant requires. Add it in your app and your plants will never have to feel neglected again!!

                    <br><br>To stop this problem from spreading further, we have taken up an initiative through this app. For every 50th download, we will plant 1 tree/plant. Furthermore, for every 100 plants added in the app, we will plant 1 more tree/plant. You can always  catch all the updates on our Social Media handles. Please do contribute to our initiative and help expand it by making use of this app.
