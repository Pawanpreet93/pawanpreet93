                <h3>It does not work</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        But it does! Solar power has been in existence for decades and has only improved with time. It is one of the fastest growing sectors purely because its energy output is now better than conventional sources. Countries around the world have adopted it as mainstream (Europe, USA etc.) in spite of having fewer sunny days.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The technology will get cheaper if I wait.</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Everything will get better – but Delhi should not and cannot afford to wait. The electricity from Solar is already cheaper than that from Coal, Oil etc. so technically the feasibility is already justified. It is not like the computer industry where the faster laptop comes out in 6 months. The very marginal benefits of waiting will not compensate for the huge savings you can start to make from the next month. In fact you save more by investing today than waiting to install a cheaper system years from now.

                <h3>Solar panels will destroy my roof</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        A typical solar installation has absolutely no moving parts and sits silently on the roof. At Clenergize we take design and aesthetics very seriously. Our customized mounting arrangements blend seamlessly with the architecture of the house. There are no perforations, chipping or breaking. In fact we offer materials with color variations to merge with the theme of the house. The installation is so benign that you can remove and reinstall should you decide to build another floor!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Solar power is way too complicated.</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        If it was, it would not be taught in 9th grade! It is in fact the simplest way of producing electricity by using the energy from the sun. Only 2 components comprise the full plant – the solar panels to grab and generate the electricity and an inverter to turn it into usable AC power. Compared to the 10,000 moving parts of a hydro-electric or coal plant – this has 0 moving parts. It is safer and lasts longer than any household item you may own today – and we guarantee it!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>I will pay a lot to maintain it</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is the best myth we like to Bust! Typically you will be asked to clean the panels once in 2 months. That’s like taking a brush and cleaning the dust off or spraying some water. We cannot even put a cost to such an exercise. You clean your house and car more often – the solar plant is not very demanding. The panels come with a performance guarantee of 25 years. What you must know is that the CLENERGIZE app has built in notifications and alarms should anything happen to the plant. Both the client and CLENERGIZE will know instantly and be advised of the actions needed.

                <h3>What materials are used & from where</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        We use fully certified panels from Global Tier 1 manufacturers. The inverters and electrical components are sourced from Europe and the mounting arrangements are customized for each house. Like we said before – we emphasize strongly on the quality of the plant and its design. It is made to last for decades and is planned well considering the weather of the region.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Roof space needed</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is best discussed on a case to case basis, but if you have anywhere above 10sqm of space on your rooftop then you can generate 2kW of power. We also have ultra-high quality panels that can generate more in constrained spaces. Let us give you a free feasibility study for you to understand this better.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Performance under wind, hail, rain &amp; storm</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is what Panel manufacturers love to brag about and it’s also true. The Solar panels are designed to withstand approx. 30 mm hailstones hitting at 100km/hr. Rain in fact clears the panel of dust and debris. The mounting arrangement is built to withstand winds of over 160km/hr. The panels are also earthed to protect against lightning. In any case we consider only 300 Sunny days while designing your plant to give you a realistic estimate of the production. With this much emphasis on safety – the longevity of the plant is guaranteed.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Monkeys &amp; Theft!</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I know this question always pops up with the folks in NCR and yes we are fully prepared to answer it. The mounting arrangement is strong enough to tackle gale force winds so monkeys swinging on it will not have much of an impact. It is next to impossible to pry out and steal a 2sqm solar panel that is hardwired to the plant as the mounting does not support conventional tools. In the off chance of that occurrence – the CLENERGIZE app has a set of alarms to warn of sudden drops in connected power and thereby pinpoint the theft.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>How safe is the installation.</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Let’s get technical – the solar plant consists of 0 moving parts and components that have a warranty for 25 years. It is geared for extremely rough weather and is rigidly mounted. The surge protection protects against lightning strikes. The double disconnects for DC and AC offer backup protection to protect your plant and the grid. The high quality components ensure that power flows efficiently and routs the excess to the grid. The designs are always more compliant that the local laws and at CLENERGIZE we make sure of that with rigorous testing.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Reliability, Longevity &amp; Warranty (how long will it last)</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The solar plant is designed with components with stringent quality certifications. These are used in operation globally and are tested for harsh climate conditions. A typical plant can easily last for 30 years with product warranties given for 20-25 years. This is a very big number if you know the standard warranties given now days for anything you own. Typical cars have a 5 year period. And IPhone has a 1 year warranty! The long term warranty is assured by the panel manufacturers.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Aesthetics and attention to detail.</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        We at CLENERGIZE take our design very seriously. Our team of engineers also have a very creative bent. When you call us for a free feasibility – you will see a full 3D rendering of your plant on your roof. You can see the minute details we focus on (color of conduits, shape and size of mounting etc.). You will not find a partner who stresses more on aesthetics and the look and feel of things than us.

                <h3>Relocation &amp; Scalability</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The Solar plant is designed and assembled in a Plug-and-Play manner. Should you decide to add another floor – it is very easy to disassemble and reassemble on the rooftop. If you let us know of your plans or future provisions – we can make it easier by installing it in a manner that is faster to relocate. The plant is also scalable – meaning that you can add more panels should you wish to increase your power output and get more energy. Only the inverter may need to be upgraded.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Monitoring capability</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is the most interesting part as it is unique to CLENERGIZE. We offer you a beautifully crafted and powerful application that tells you all you need to know about your plant. It works on any platform (laptops, smartphones, IPad). Along with the basic details about energy produced and consumed you can see your usage patterns, savings made (daily, weekly, monthly, lifetime). It also has built in notifications to remind you for cleaning, warn you of any faults. All you need is an internet connection and you can view the plant details from anywhere in the world. Test drive the app here.

                <h3>How to determine if your home is right for solar.</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        If you are the owner of the roof space and you have considerable area that is not shadowed during the day – you are an ideal candidate for solar power. Call us for a free site visit and we will give you a feasibility study to explain better. It takes only 15 mins!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Productivity – how much can I produce (air con, geyser etc.)</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In technical terms you are looking at around 5-6 units per day per kW installed. A typical 3kW plant generates around 15-18 units a day. During its operation it can sustain major loads such as air con, geysers etc. It works in parallel with the grid or generators to minimize their usage.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>What happens to the excess power?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In the case of the plant producing more power than is needed by the house – the excess is sent to the grid. This is calculated by a NET meter that measures power in and power out. At the end of the month you will see the adjustment in your bill. Excess power credits are carried forward to the next month’s billing to offset it. This is a good way to reduce your bill even when you don’t consume. Next time you leave the house for a vacation or work – your plant is making you money!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>How does solar power work at night &amp; when I am not at home?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Well to be blunt about this – it doesn’t work at night! The plant simply rests and waits for the next rays of sun. Now should you be out of the house – on vacation, work etc.; the plant produces power and sends the excess to the grid. This is measured via the NET meter as explained above. The final bill generated is the power consumed minus the power sent to the grid. In case you sent more to the grid – then it is carried forward to the next month.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>I already have generators and inverters – how does this work now?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The solar plant on your rooftop will be an independent energy source. It will work in parallel with the electricity coming from the grid and any other backup source that you may have. You do not have to get rid of any of the inverters or generators that you have already bought or connected – as the solar plant connects separately. It is also configured in a way to minimize the use of the generator in the case of a power-cut. No need for expensive fuel or cumbersome batteries.

                <h3>How much will the installation cost?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The cost of the solution depends on the size of plant that is feasible for your house. This can be determined very quickly by a simple feasibility study. In any case Clenergize will install the full system at lower than market prices for the same installation type.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>How fast is the payback period?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The payback period depends on 3 factors – the initial investment, the productivity of the plant and the weather. Considering that there have been no extreme changes in the weather pattern of our city, and working on the worst case scenario – we optimize the plant for maximum productivity. This is done with decades of meteo data and simulations as a standard practice. We can see a payback period anywhere between 3-6 years for a given installation.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>How fast is the electricity tariff rising and how does solar help?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        If you look on an average the rate of electricity that you are billed at, has risen at around 5% per anum and is expected to reach 7%. Every year you pay more than before even though you take almost the same from the grid. Solar power cuts your consumption from the grid drastically and also gives back to the grid. The cost of this electricity is 0 and will remain 0 for as long as you have the plant.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Are there tax benefits?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        For sure! The central government has classified solar projects as high depreciation assets and so you can claim 80% of the project value as a deductible from your taxable income in the following year. This means that you save roughly a quarter of the project value as tax rebate. This is a very strong incentive for plant owners as the payback reduces drastically.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Are there government subsidies?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Though the central government pledges to give 15% of the project value as an incentive, we can honestly say that it has a very marginal impact on the payback period as the funds take a while to reach you. The government will slowly withdraw the scheme as solar has now become so feasible that they do not need to incentivize it. We have seen this same pattern in all the major countries. But as of today you can avail 15% subsidy for the project value.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>How does the reference plan work?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The reference plan is very simple. It rewards those who help spread the word and make our city an environmentally benign place to live in. For each house that you refer, that decides to install the system – we shall send you a cheque of 5,000. Simply put – you stand to earn thousands if your friends and family agree to install the systems and produce clean power. It’s a win-win and a way of letting you share the success.
                    </p>

                <h3>How to finance the project?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        While it is most feasible to install your system by paying outright, there are financing options available with most banks. There are loans available in the home improvement category that have very low interest rates and a feasible payback period. A good point to note is that a well-designed plant will be able to pay off the EMI of the loan by bill savings each month and also generate profit.

                    <p>
                        An average plant can save over 4000KG of CO2 each year. This is a significant environmental impact when you scale it to the number of houses that are present and the capacity of each. In other words it’s like NOT DRIVING 11000 km. It can also be taken as 122 trees growing for 10 years. Now that’s a lot of saving for just 1 year. Over the course of the plant you are looking at 140 tons of CO2 saved!

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Delhi in particular is supplied by 3 distribution companies. The power deficit for Delhi is huge and often results in grid failure as the demand is forever more than supply. This results in power cuts and even if you do not face it in your area – it results in hours and hours of diesel fuel burnt in millions of generators in your city. The government launched the solar policy with a view to address this issue. Long term power security will be an important factor in the future. Solar helps you be more in control of your power and reduces dependency on the government. In fact some residential solar projects tend to give back more energy than they consumed in the whole year.
